# Slim Backbone Sample Framework
Slim backend serving a backbone app

# Purpose
Occasionally I need to spin up a small service for testing+fiddling with code. This greatly accelerates that process by handling creating both a small php backend as well as running a Backbonee.js front end. 

# Installation
Clone this repo
Run `php composer.phar install`
Configure your Nginx/Apache to serve `public/index.php` or run `php -S public/index.php` for local development
